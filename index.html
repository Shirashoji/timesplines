    <p id="abstract">
        Timelines are essential for visually communicating chronological narratives and reflecting on the personal and
        cultural significance of historical events. Existing visualization tools tend to support conventional linear
        representations, but fail to capture personal idiosyncratic conceptualizations of time. In response, we built
        <b>TimeSplines</b>, a visualization authoring tool that allows people to sketch multiple free-form temporal axes
        and
        populate them with heterogeneous time-oriented data via incremental and lazy data binding. Authors can bend,
        compress, and stretch temporal axes to emphasize or de-emphasize intervals based on their personal importance;
        they can also annotate the axes with text and figurative elements to convey contextual information. The results
        of two user studies show how people appropriate the concepts in TimeSplines to express their own
        conceptualization of time. Our curated gallery of images demonstrates the expressive potential of our approach.

        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <p>
            We evaluated TimeSplines using three established methods:
            a reproduction study with 12 participants to evaluate the system's usability;
            a free-form evaluation with four designers and visualization researchers
            to evaluate different use cases and creative workflows;
            and a gallery of visualizations produced with TimeSplines to demonstrate the expressive power of our
            approach.

                        a darked patch to emphasize the switchback nature of the path.

            We conducted a reproduction study with 12 participants to evaluate the systems usability, i.e. if users can
            quickly understand how to use the tools features. From the reproduction study, we found participants were
            able to understand and sometimes appropriate the concepts of idiosyncratic representations within
            TimeSplines, such as by creating a number of variations of the line they were asked to reproduce.

        <h2>Study 2: Free-form Study</h2>

        <p>
            We conducted a reproduction study with 12 participants to evaluate the systems usability, i.e. if users can
            quickly understand how to use the tools features. From the reproduction study, we found participants were
            able to understand and sometimes appropriate the concepts of idiosyncratic representations within
            TimeSplines, such as by creating a number of variations of the line they were asked to reproduce.

        <p>Study 2 participants were walked through the following image to give an idea what sort of visualizations
            the tool was targeted at, without biasing their thinking by showing them additional visualizations created
            in the system. The image is shown at reduced resolution here.</p>
